<p>On this page I give a brief overview of some of my personal projects and open

github, which is where you&#8217;ll find more detailed information about each
project.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been a long-time user of NetBSD and run it on a wide range of hardware
(sparc, mips, vax, i386, amd64, aarch64, &#8230;&#8203;)  Over the years I have made
minor contributions to various parts of the system.  Some more recent ones
include the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/netbsd-src/tree/mdehling_cgdconfig">cgdconfig-zfs</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Added zfs verification to the cryptographic disk driver configuration
utility cgdconfig(8).  This allows using raw cgd devices as vdevs in a zfs
pool without requiring an intermediate disklabel or partition table.
(<a href="https://gnats.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=58212">PR #58212</a>, <a href="https://freshbsd.org/netbsd/src/commit/l8DqFN0POdK6MJ9F">committed</a>.)</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/netbsd-cgdzfsroot">netbsd-cgdzfsroot</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>An initial ramdisk with encrypted ZFS root pool support.  Using this ramdisk
it is possible to set up a system in such a way that the only unencrypted
data is the UEFI boot partition and all persistent file systems are ZFS.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/netbsd-src/tree/mdehling_thinkpad">netbsd-thinkpad-battery</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adds sysctl tunables allowing the user to set charging thresholds, inhibit
charging, or force discharge ThinkPad batteries in order to extend their
battery lifespan.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/netbsd-src/tree/mdehling_acpibat">netbsd-acpibat</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Adds sysctl tunables for control method batteries implementing the ACPI
battery maintenance data (_BMD) and control (_BMD) methods.  I don&#8217;t have
the hardware to test this, so feedback is welcome.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/netbsd-src">netbsd-autofs</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>I am currently working on getting nested automounting to work.  While the
new (FreeBSD) autofs automounter is in many ways better than the previous
Berkeley implementation, lack of nested automounting is a serious regression
and needs to be fixed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, I also contribute to <a href="https://pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>, a cross platform
package management system and NetBSD&#8217;s default package manager.  I maintain a
number of packages, among them are: LuaJIT{2,21,-git}, neovim-git, neatroff-*,
RE/flex, 8bc, py-notmuch2, py-lieer, and others.</p>

<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve worked on a Python package for neural style transfer that I
call <a href="https://github.com/mdehling/nstesia">NSTesia</a>.  I started this project to become more
familiar with TensorFlow, and to test and solidify my understanding of the
literature.  These are some of the style transfer algorithms I implemented:</p>

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/johnson-fast-style-transfer">johnson-fast-style-transfer</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>A pre-trained neural network is employed to compute a style vector for a
given style image.  This vector is then used to train a style transfer
network to turn arbitrary content images into stylized images (pastiches).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/johnson-fast-style-transfer-pytorch">johnson-fast-style-transfer-pytorch</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Another implementation of Johnson&#8217;s style transfer model, this time using
PyTorch.  Uses Hydra for simple training configuration.  Pre-trained models
for various styles made available via torch hub.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/dumoulin-multi-style-transfer">dumoulin-multi-style-transfer</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Style vectors are computed for a small number of style images instead of
just a single one.  A style transfer network is trained to turn arbitrary
content images into pastiches in any (mix) of the given styles.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/ghiasi-arbitrary-style-transfer">ghiasi-arbitrary-style-transfer</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>A style transfer network is trained on pairs of style and content images to
produce stylized versions of images in previously unseen styles.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/kolkin-style-transport">kolkin-style-transport</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>A iterative approach to style transfer based on methods of optimal
transport.</p>

<h2 id="_sun_openboot_firmware">Sun OpenBoot Firmware</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was introduced to Unix workstations in 2002 and have been fascinated by them
ever since.  From that first Ultra 80, I&#8217;ve always had a particular interest
in Sun Microsystems.  These days I own a small collection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default resolution of Sun workstations for the longest time was 1152x900,
an awkward mode when trying to use LCD displays.  Luckily the hardware is
quite flexible and with a few modifications to the firmware it can be
convinced to produce high-resolution LCD-friendly VESA video modes.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/fcode-tools">fcode-tools</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>A collection of tools I wrote to aid in reverse engineering and modifying
OpenBoot device firmware.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/sslx-vesa-mod">sslx-vesa-mod</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>With this mod, the SPARCstation LX onboard CG6 framebuffer will generate
resolutions up to 1600x1200 or 1920x1080.  The repository also contains an
explanation of how to reprogram the ICS1562M pixel clock generator chip.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/tgx-plus-vesa-mod">tgx-plus-vesa-mod</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>The Sun TGX+ framebuffer is very similar but has 4MB of VRAM, enough to
increase the resolution to 1920x1200 or even 2560x1600.  This repository
also contains an explanation of how to load firmware over the network in
testing.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/cg14-vesa-mod">cg14-vesa-mod</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>The SPARCstation 10SX/20 onboard CG14 is a 24-bit capable framebuffer with
up to 8MB VRAM.  It can display the same resolutions as the TGX+ in
double-buffered mode, or up to 1600x1200 or 1920x1080 in 24-bit true color.
Getting X11 to work on a modified CG14 required some changes to the
<code>xf86-video-suncg14</code> driver for which I submitted the
<a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-sparc/2021/11/07/msg002411.html">necessary patches</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_the_sun_framebuffer_logo_collection">The Sun Framebuffer Logo Collection</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought that the boot screen on a Sun workstation looked really
cool with the little logo next to the banner.  During my work on the
framebuffer firmware, I decided to start a collection of these logos
(<a href="https://github.com/mdehling/sun-fb-logos">sun-fb-logos</a>).  This project turned out to be
surprisingly popular: it was shared on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31403726">Hacker News</a>, and
since then people from all over the world, including several former employees
of Sun Microsystems, have contacted me to contribute.</p>

<h2 id="_sparc_emulation">SPARC Emulation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wrote a simple Solaris 7/8 device driver for the Aurora Personality Chip
(<a href="https://github.com/mdehling/apc-driver">apc-driver</a>).  The APC provides power management
functions for the SPARCstation 4/5&#8212;&#8203;the default target of the QEMU SPARC
emulator.  Enabling this driver inside the virtual machine significantly
reduces host CPU load, allowing me to run it on a laptop without draining the
battery too quickly.</p>

<p>Long ago I came into the possession of an IBM PS/2 P75 Portable, a briefcase
shaped computer with a 10 inch orange gas plasma display.  After diving deep
into the spec sheets I finally figured out how to get it to boot from a
standard PC floppy drive.  I designed a little PCB to convert a PC drive to
one suitable for the IBM PS/2 P70/P75.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/m48txx-battery-fix">m48txx-battery-fix</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Certain Sun SPARCstations use M48TXX NVRAM chips to store their mac address,
serial number, and other configuration.  These chips have a builtin battery
which fails eventually.  This little PCB provides a clean solution to the
issue.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://github.com/mdehling/vs3100-scsi-terminator">vs3100-scsi-terminator</a></dt>

<p>Replacement for the proprietary, hard to find, and expensive SCSI terminator
required to run a VAXstation 3100.  I know it looks like regular wide SCSI,
but it really is not!</p>

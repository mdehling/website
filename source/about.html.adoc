My name is Malte Dehling.  I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, raised in the
Netherlands, and educated in Germany.  I have recently moved back to the
United States where I currently live in La Jolla, California.

I graduated _magna cum laude_ with a doctoral degree (_doctor rerum
naturalium_) in mathematics from the University of GÃ¶ttingen.  For my
{goediss-8401}[dissertation] I did research on the homotopy theory for
symmetric operads and homotopy Lie algebras, a topic I became interested in
during my master's.  In case you're curious, head over to my old
{archived-hp}[academic homepage] where I have published a few blog posts
explaining my work.

More recently I have become fascinated with machine learning, and I am
currently looking for work in this field.

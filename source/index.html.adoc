Welcome to my website!  This is my attempt to organize my projects and
thoughts for both my own benefit and, hopefully, that of others.

As part of my interest in retrocomputing, I published a few firmware mods
enabling high resolution LCD friendly video modes on old Sun Microsystems
hardware: link:{gh}/sslx-vesa-mod[sslx-vesa-mod],
link:{gh}/tgx-plus-vesa-mod[tgx-plus-vesa-mod],
link:{gh}/cg14-vesa-mod[cg14-vesa-mod].  To aid in the reverse engineering
required to do so, I wrote link:{gh}/fcode-tools[FCode tools].  I also
maintain the link:{gh}/sun-fb-logos[Sun framebuffer logo collection], a
project that has gained some popularity since it was shared on
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31403726[Hacker News] recently.

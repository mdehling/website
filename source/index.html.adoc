Welcome to my personal website!  This is my attempt to organize my projects
and thoughts for both my own benefit and, hopefully, that of others.  (Also, I
just needed a domain for my servers...)

This is what's on the menu:

[.site-index]
link:/projects[Projects]::
An overview of some of the projects I've been working on recently.
link:/about[About]::
Information about who I am.
link:/contact[Contact]::
Ways to get in touch with me.

My name is Malte Dehling.  I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, raised in the
Netherlands, and educated in Germany.  I have recently moved back to the
United States where I currently live in La Jolla, California.

I graduated _magna cum laude_ with a doctoral degree (_doctor rerum
naturalium_) in mathematics from the University of GÃ¶ttingen.  For my
https://dx.doi.org/10.53846/goediss-8401[dissertation] I did research on the
homotopy theory for symmetric operads and homotopy Lie algebras, a topic I
became interested in during my master's.  In case you're curious, head over to
my old https://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/mdehling/[academic homepage] where I have
published a few blog posts explaining my work.

More recently I have become fascinated with machine learning, and I am
currently looking for work in this field.
